Pick any technique of your choice: Logistic Regression, DT, Ensembles.
Write a function to compute L1Norm of a d-dim vector W.
Write a function to compute dL1Norm(W)/dW , W is a d-dim vector
In random Forest how do we sample the data?
Follow up questions
Why do we sample the data with replacement? Why don’t we use sampling without replacement
 
4. Difference between GBDT and XGBOOST
Follow up questions
Why do you think Xgboost used randomization in addition to standard GBDT models.
How do we avoid overfitting in standard GBDT- shrinkage values, no of base models as hyperparam
GBDT we anyways avoid overfitting: using underfit base models, shrinkage values, no of base models as hyperparam. Why do we need additional randomization in Xgboost?
 
5. Two concentric hyperspheres in 10-dim space. 1000 data-points/observations from both these spheres [1000X10 data matrix]. Noisy data. We don’t know which datapoint belongs to which sphere. Find the equations of these two hyperspheres.
6. Programming-
A: ID, Name---- n rows
B: ID, Age----- k rows
C: ID, Name, Age [ Inner JOIN in SQL or Pandas.Merge]
Compute C given A and B from scratch(basically we have to implement inner join without using sql or pandas.merge in optimized way)
Follow up question,
what is the time complexity of your solution?

1.
Given - We know logistics regression, svm become biased toward more class data when there is imbalance situation.
Question - But when we do multiclass classification then we use method like one vs rest.
Which mean if we have to do classification of apple, banana, orange then we will do like this
Apple vs [banana , orange]
Banana vs [apple, orange] etc.
So indirectly we are making our dataset to imbalance because  now data become [100 vs 200] if we have 100 data for each class
2. Why model having low R2 score can be still good model.
